# Natural Language Processing (DATA448) Directed Studies

This repository contains code from my directed studies in Natural Language Processing (DATA448) under the supervision of Dr. Irene Vrbik (Assistant Professor at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan).

Currently, you'll find code for practice and enhancing my understanding of NLP concepts including Topics Modeling. As I begin work on the project, the repository will continue to be updated with code from my final project.
